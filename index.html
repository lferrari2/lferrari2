	<p>Here is a quote from GFE Program Director, Maggie Guerra Marks, on the meaning of homecooked food:</p>

	<blockquote cite ="http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=e15e9817d626f05d2f83b0d89&id=162a95de20">
		<p>My good friend, a new mom, texted me with an out of the blue question. <i>In my opinion, why in the age of excellent and prevalent take-out options does a home cooked meal almost always taste better?</i> She was wondering this quite seriously. No matter how many healthy or inexpensive options exist, they are never as satisfying as a home cooked meal - how is that? The best response I could think of was that <b>a home cooked meal is an act of love.</b> It's full of intention. Cooking is deeply soulful and as heady as it may sound, maybe you really can taste the love.</p>
